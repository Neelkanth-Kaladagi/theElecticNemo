Description:
In this final stage, game should be concluded with game over or player winning scenario. It should also incorporate menu giving player options to
customize the game. The game should also have an AI which make some sprites smart.

XML File changes:

safeDistance( For AI) tag and some  menu & Help tag


The Specs that I implemented are:

1. Integrated Menu which has options to 
	-Start game
	-Choose Difficulty level, higher the difficulty level, tougher will be to kill the shark as her health bar will update slow.
	-Help - Help shows an extensive help about the goal and controls of the game.
	-Exit - To exit from the game

2. Implemented health bar for Shark and player, the player wins if shark health becomes 0 and game is over if player's health becomes 0

3. Implemented AI, Octopus will evade from the player fish. They will always be at a safe Distance which can be customized from game.xml

4. If Shark is collided with player, the health reduces faster.

5. Added extra sounds for Game over, player win and menu.

6. There are no leaks.
